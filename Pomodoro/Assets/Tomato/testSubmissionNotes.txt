This app is about as simple as it gets.
From a testing perspective, personally, I did this:
checked on Windows 10 desktop, and Windows 10 phone
played with the 2 sliders to make sure their values rippled through to the text boxes
checked that the following combinations worked:
default duration (20 minutes) with default interval prompt (5 minutes)
duration of 4 minutes with interval of 1 minute
checked that sound toggled on and off correctly
checked that performance seemed acceptable.

Thanks a lot of reviewing :-)
